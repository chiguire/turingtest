# There are no Vampires Here

14-16 November 2014.

A game made in two days for the Creative Assembly-internal Franco Jam, in honour of Simon Franco. By Mary Safro, Stelios Avramidis and Ciro Dur√°n.

Requires two players, each one control six keys in the keyboard. Each one is dancer in the floor, one is the vampire, and another is the vampire killer. The objective is to kill one another. Neither knows who they are in the floor, and they must be able to figure it out without the other knowing. You must sync with the music and the other dancers, or you will be pointed at and frozen momentarily.
